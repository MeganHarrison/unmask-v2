## 📊 Summary

| Agent | Status | Health Check | Main Functionality | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| Orchestrator | ✅ Working | N/A | ✅ Intent Classification | Fully functional |
| Memory | ✅ Working | N/A | ⚠️ Needs bindings | Requires D1, KV, Vectorize setup |
| Coaching | ✅ Working | ✅ Healthy | 🚧 In development | Placeholder implementation |
| Data Ingestion | ✅ Working | ✅ Healthy | Ready for implementation | Needs upload logic |

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Configure Memory Agent Bindings**:
   - Add D1 database binding
   - Configure KV namespace
   - Set up Vectorize index

2. **Implement Coaching Logic**:
   - Add AI integration for coaching responses
   - Connect to relationship data

3. **Complete Data Ingestion**:
   - Implement CSV/file upload handling
   - Add data processing pipeline

4. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test agent-to-agent communication
   - Verify orchestrator routing to other agents
